# B612 nerd font patched

Nerd font patched (complete) version of the PolarSys B612 font from here: https://b612-font.com/

Note! This repository is using the forked B612 font from here: https://github.com/ekaitz-zarraga/b612 which has a strike through on the zero for the mono spaced font to better differentiate from 'O' when programming.
